## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
  - Kenny: Leadership, Technical skills, Communication
  - Monica: Curiosity, Communication, Driven
  - TJ:
  - Nick:

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
  - Kenny:
  - Monica: Inspire innovation out of the box thinking.
  - TJ:
  - Nick:

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

  - Kenny: Curiosity, Technical Skills
  - Monica: Technical Skills, Tool Competency, Innovation
  - TJ:
  - Nick:

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
Review the code in the morning and speak about modifications made the night before merging to main branch.
Divide the work from to do list.
Break off and work on functions.
Check in when a feature is complete and push to own feature branch/staging.
NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

  - Team meeting, to discuss issues and concerns.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

  -Team meeting, to discuss issues and concerns. Make sure the workload is divided fairly at the start of day to try to avoid this kind of issue.

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is
impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Creating a safe space to allow for questions and exploration.

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - Team meeting to discuss if there are any blockers that we can help overcome.

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - We will reach out to an instructor when we as a team cannot come to a resolution.

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

- Hours of Communication:

  - Kenny: 9am -6pm PST
  - Monica: 9am - 6pm PST
  - Tj:
  - Nick:

- Communication Platforms:
  - Slack, Remo

- Break schedule:
  - Flexible, 10 minutes every hour or when needed with a Lunch break at 12 pm PST

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Team meeting, focus on the MVP.

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

  - Communicate through slack and relate any concerns and questions there.

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

  - Check in on each other at the start of the day and throughout the work day.

- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

  - Include everyone and ask for their insight on each topic.

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

  - Creating wireframe for each page that note features needed on page.
  - Divide tasks by features needed on that work day.
  - Keep track of progress on trello or Github,

- What project management tool will be used?

  - Trello or Github

## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - The front end and the backend.

- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  - We will have one repository that each of us will fork and clone to our own local machines.

- What is your Git flow?

  - Push the feature to its own branch, merge to staging, and if everything coincides with each other merge staging to Main.
  - Main branch: for the most recently deployed product
  - Staging: Stage for current workday features
  - Individual branches for features.

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

- How many people must review a PR?

  - At least 2 people will review the PR for the feature branch

- Who merges PRs?

  - One of the two reviewers will merge to staging.

- How often will you merge?

  - Merge feature branches to staging at the end of work day and Merge to Main in the morning in case changes had to be made.

- How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

  - Request a team huddle, and reach out via slack.
